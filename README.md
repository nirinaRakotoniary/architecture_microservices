This repository implements microservices architecture with 4 main microservices : 
1 - product-service is the business layer of the project. We will run in inn three different port (e.g: 8080, 8081, 8082)
2 - config-service is the central configuration of all microservices and each microservice consult this one to get its configuration
3 - discovery service make each microservice visible for each other
4 - proxy-service is the proxy that handle the client's request and transfer it to one of the product-services running equitably

For testing, we need to run firstly the config-service, then the discovery-service, the proxy-service and lastly the product-service in more than one port.
In our case, we just need to launch request http://localhost:9999/product-service/messages in our navigator,the proxy will handle it and transfer to one product-service, then we can find message "c'est moi qui ai r√©pondu!" logged in the service that handled the request.

When we launch more request, we can notice that it's distributed equitably for each product-service.
